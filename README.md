# CarPricePrediction

The Car Price Prediction project is a **machine learning** based web application developed using flask framework that predicts the price of used cars. It utilizes historical car data, including features such as the car's maker, model, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, and other relevant factors, to provide an estimate of the car's market value.

The project aims to assist both car buyers and sellers in making informed decisions by providing an accurate estimation of a car's price. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, the application offers a reliable and objective assessment of a car's value, taking into account various influential factors.
